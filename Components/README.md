**Updates**

(1) Components for the F1/10 simulator have been tested and can be integrated with the toolchain.

(2) Components for the DeepNNCar has been migrated from python to ROS and needs some more testing. Also, some of the F1/10 topics have hardware specific topics. We will need some synchronization to use it for all the platforms.
